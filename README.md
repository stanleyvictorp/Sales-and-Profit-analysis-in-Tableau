# Atliq Hardware Sales and Profit Analysis

## Overview

Atliq Hardware, a burgeoning hardware business, has conducted an in-depth sales and profit analysis using Tableau. This repository encompasses a comprehensive collection of visualizations showcasing critical business metrics such as profit by market, total revenue, profit margin % by market, profit trends, customer segmentation, total sales, revenue by market, quantity sold by market, top 10 customers, and top 5 products.

### Problem Statement

The primary objective of this project is to leverage these insightful visualizations to drive actionable strategies and improve operational efficiency. While we have extensively visualized the sales and profit data, the focus now shifts to extracting actionable insights to address specific business challenges:

- **Market Penetration:** Identifying markets with lower profitability despite high revenue and devising strategies to enhance profitability in those areas.
- **Customer Segmentation:** Understanding customer behavior, preferences, and purchase patterns to tailor marketing strategies for better engagement.
- **Product Performance:** Analyzing the top 5 products to enhance their contribution to revenue and exploring potential diversification or improvements.
- **Profitability Trends:** Unveiling trends in profit margins and understanding the factors driving fluctuations.
- **Sales Optimization:** Identifying opportunities to maximize sales volume and revenue by understanding quantity sold per market.
